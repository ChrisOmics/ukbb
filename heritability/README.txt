First create a mafdafld file with all SNPs
example:

SNPID A1 A2 MAF DAF LD
10:100000625 G A 0.4321 0.4321 132.021

then run the scripts make_features to make a binary rbin file that you will use for the matching.

Next run the  match_features script 
You can then run the compare baseline to calculate statistics
